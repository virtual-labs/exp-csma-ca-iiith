    {
      "question": "How does the backoff mechanism in CSMA/CA help in avoiding collisions?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It forces all devices to wait for the same time before transmission",
        "b": "It introduces a random delay before retransmission",
        "c": "It immediately retries transmission after a failed attempt",
        "d": "It prevents hidden node problems"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! If all devices wait the same time, collisions can still occur.",
        "b": "Correct! The random backoff reduces the chance of simultaneous retransmissions.",
        "c": "Incorrect! Immediate retries increase the risk of collisions.",
        "d": "Incorrect! RTS/CTS helps with the hidden node problem, not the backoff mechanism."

    {
      "question": "What does the Clear-to-Send (CTS) signal indicate in CSMA/CA?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The channel is free for any device to transmit",
        "b": "The sender can now transmit data",
        "c": "A collision has occurred",
        "d": "The transmission failed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! CTS is only sent to a specific sender, not to all devices.",
        "b": "Correct! CTS informs the sender that it has reserved the channel and can transmit.",
        "c": "Incorrect! CSMA/CA aims to avoid collisions rather than detect them.",
        "d": "Incorrect! CTS does not indicate transmission failure."

    {
      "question": "What happens when a device detects that the channel is busy in CSMA/CA?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It transmits immediately",
        "b": "It waits for an ACK signal",
        "c": "It defers transmission and starts a backoff timer",
        "d": "It increases its transmission power"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! Transmitting on a busy channel increases collision probability.",
        "b": "Incorrect! The device has not yet transmitted, so an ACK is irrelevant.",
        "c": "Correct! CSMA/CA defers transmission and initiates a backoff timer.",
        "d": "Incorrect! Increasing power does not resolve contention issues."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "If two devices transmit at the same time despite CSMA/CA, what happens?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The transmission is successful for both devices",
        "b": "Both devices receive an ACK",
        "c": "Packets may collide and require retransmission",
        "d": "The devices will shut down"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! Simultaneous transmission leads to packet collisions.",
        "b": "Incorrect! If a collision occurs, neither device receives an ACK.",
        "c": "Correct! Collided packets are lost and need retransmission.",
        "d": "Incorrect! Devices do not shut down due to collisions."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does CSMA/CA handle the hidden node problem?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By using RTS/CTS before transmitting data",
        "b": "By allowing simultaneous transmissions",
        "c": "By increasing transmission power",
        "d": "By using CSMA/CD instead"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! RTS/CTS helps coordinate transmissions and avoid hidden node issues.",
        "b": "Incorrect! Simultaneous transmissions can cause collisions.",
        "c": "Incorrect! Increasing power does not resolve the hidden node problem.",
        "d": "Incorrect! CSMA/CD is ineffective in wireless networks."
