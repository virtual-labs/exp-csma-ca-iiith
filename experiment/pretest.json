      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! CSMA/CA avoids collisions by sensing the channel and using a random backoff before transmission.",
        "b": "Incorrect! CSMA/CA does not detect collisions like CSMA/CD.",
        "c": "Incorrect! Synchronous time slots are used in TDMA, not CSMA/CA.",

    {
      "question": "Why does CSMA/CA use an acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To confirm successful data transmission and avoid retransmission",
        "b": "To detect collisions like CSMA/CD",
        "c": "To allow multiple users to transmit at the same time",
        "d": "To increase transmission speed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! CSMA/CA uses ACK to confirm reception and avoid unnecessary retransmissions.",
        "b": "Incorrect! Unlike CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA does not detect collisions but prevents them.",
        "c": "Incorrect! CSMA/CA ensures only one device transmits at a time.",
        "d": "Incorrect! ACK does not increase speed; it ensures reliability."

      "question": "What is the primary reason CSMA/CA is used in wireless networks instead of CSMA/CD?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Wireless networks cannot detect collisions efficiently",
        "b": "Wireless networks have higher transmission speeds",
        "c": "CSMA/CD is more expensive",
        "d": "Wireless networks do not experience collisions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Wireless networks cannot detect collisions effectively, so CSMA/CA avoids them.",
        "b": "Incorrect! Transmission speed is not the reason for choosing CSMA/CA.",
        "c": "Incorrect! Cost is not the primary reason for using CSMA/CA.",

      "question": "What is the purpose of the RTS/CTS mechanism in CSMA/CA?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To reduce the hidden node problem",
        "b": "To increase data transmission speed",
        "c": "To eliminate all collisions",
        "d": "To detect errors in received packets"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! RTS/CTS helps in reducing the hidden node problem by reserving the channel.",
        "b": "Incorrect! RTS/CTS does not necessarily increase speed.",
        "c": "Incorrect! It reduces collisions but does not eliminate them entirely.",
        "d": "Incorrect! RTS/CTS is not designed for error detection."

      "question": "What happens when multiple devices sense an idle channel in CSMA/CA?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All devices transmit immediately",
        "b": "Devices use a random backoff timer before transmitting",
        "c": "The first device to transmit gains control of the channel",
        "d": "All devices enter a collision state"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! Simultaneous transmission could cause a collision.",
        "b": "Correct! CSMA/CA introduces a random backoff to reduce collision chances.",
        "c": "Incorrect! There is no guarantee that a single device transmits first.",
        "d": "Incorrect! CSMA/CA prevents collisions rather than detecting them."

    {
      "question": "Why is CSMA/CA preferred in Wi-Fi networks?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because Wi-Fi signals are prone to interference and hidden nodes",
        "b": "Because CSMA/CD is faster",
        "c": "Because Wi-Fi devices do not need to sense the channel",
        "d": "Because CSMA/CA guarantees zero packet loss"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Wi-Fi networks have issues like interference and hidden nodes, making CSMA/CA more suitable.",
        "b": "Incorrect! CSMA/CD is not used in wireless networks due to collision detection limitations.",
        "c": "Incorrect! CSMA/CA requires devices to sense the channel before transmitting.",
