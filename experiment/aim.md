### Aim of the experiment

To demonstrate the **Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)** networking technique by simulating its key mechanisms: carrier sensing, the random backoff algorithm for collision avoidance, and the RTS/CTS handshake to resolve the Hidden Node Problem.
